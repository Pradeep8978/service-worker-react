## Demonstrate service worker strategies using React & Workbox

This project is to implement and demonstrate service workers with `reactjs` using `create-react-app v2`.
It uses `workbox` under the hood to implement different service worker strategies.

To play with it, open `public/custom-service-worker.js` and try a different workbox strategy.
